\subsection{Story}
7 Years From Now, I've started my journey at the age of 7 with some basic computer knowledge and then got into an Institute to learn more about Software Development, It lead me to some basics of Designing (Photoshop and Flash) \& A little bit of Development on \textbf{VB 6.0}, It was really easy to learn and then I moved on to another well recognized Institute to pursue a Diploma, Me \& My family faced alot of issues regarding my Age, but at the end Everything went on very well and After \emph{2} Semesters there, I got involved into local Development Communities and was honestly Shocked to know that what I've previously learnt keeps evolving and is rapidly changing and then I landed into a BlockChain Organization as a \textbf{BlockChain Developer} and \textbf{BlockChain Teacher},\textit{It was one of the best Professional Learning Experiences} and after I left, I got more involved into Personal Growth and it led me to alot of amazing goals and achievements \& Now I'm in Google Code In writing this ;).

\section{LaTeX Experience}
\subsection{It's the First, Amazing \& Playful}
Well Honestly speaking, It's my first time working on LaTeX and being playful. I just got to know about it in a previous task on \textit{Manim} to write a basic equation, I didn't knew this much could be done on it. In the previous task i just copy pasted most of it from Internet. Now it's Amazing to Write on TeX Maker.

\textbf{I Feel Like I can Write a Book on It ;)}

\textbf{Thank You Niharika Shrivastava \& A.Baloochi for such Amazing, Playful \& Insightful Task, Looking forward for more. =) )}
